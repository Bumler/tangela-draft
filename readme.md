# Tangela Draft

My cat got spayed so while I'm hanging out with her this weekend I'm using this opportunity to test out building a project with ChatGpt and Copilot.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following devDependencies:

- `@types/node`: Provides TypeScript type definitions for Node.js, allowing for easier development of Node.js applications in TypeScript.
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`: A plugin for the `eslint` linter that provides additional rules and support for TypeScript, allowing for more robust and error-free code.
- `@typescript-eslint/parser`: A parser for the `eslint` linter that can handle TypeScript syntax, allowing for more accurate linting of TypeScript code.
- `eslint`: A popular JavaScript linter that helps catch errors and maintain consistent code style.
- `jest`: A testing framework that makes it easy to write and run tests, helping ensure that code changes don't introduce new bugs.
- `prettier`: A code formatter that can integrate with `eslint`, making it easy to ensure that code is consistently formatted and easy to read.
- `ts-jest`: A Jest transformer that allows you to run TypeScript tests, making it easy to test TypeScript code.
- `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler and type checker, which allows you to write and maintain large-scale JavaScript applications with ease.
